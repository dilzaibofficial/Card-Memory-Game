- **JavaScript:** For game logic and interactivity.

## Game Logic

The game consists of a grid of cards, each with an emoji on the back. The objective is to match pairs of cards by flipping them over. When all pairs are matched, the game ends with a fireworks effect and restarts with a new category of emojis.

### Emoji Categories

The game features the following categories of emojis, which are selected randomly for each game:

- **Fruits:** 🍎, 🍌, 🍇, 🍉, 🍓, 🍒, 🍑, 🍍
- **Diamonds:** 💎, 🔷, 🔶, 🔸, 🔹, ♦️, ♢, ♤
- **Animals:** 🐶, 🐱, 🐭, 🐹, 🐰, 🦊, 🐻, 🐼
- **Birds:** 🦅, 🦆, 🦉, 🦜, 🐦, 🐧, 🐤, 🦢

### How It Works

1. **Shuffle and Assign Emojis:** At the start of each game, a category is randomly selected, and the emojis are shuffled and assigned to the cards.
2. **Flip Cards:** Players click on cards to flip them over and reveal the emoji.
3. **Check for Match:** If two cards are flipped, the game checks if they match.
4. **Match or Unflip:** If the cards match, they remain flipped. If not, they are flipped back after a short delay.
5. **End Game:** When all pairs are matched, a fireworks effect is displayed, and the game restarts with a new category of emojis.
